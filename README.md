# recruiting-exercises

Hi! I'm Akaash Kambath, a senior EECS undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. 
My assignment was to complete the Inventory Allocator problem.

My solution is in:
 
`inventory_allocator/src/inventory_allocator.py`.

Tests are located in:
 
`inventory_allocator/test/test_inventory_allocator.py`.

To run all tests, go to the `recruiting-exercises` directory and run:

`python -m unittest`

For more details on the results of each test, run:

`python -m unittest -v`
